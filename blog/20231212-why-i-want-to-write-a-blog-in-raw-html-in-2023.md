title: "Why I want to write a blog in raw html in 2023"

I started my career life as a developer by writing html using a text editor in my high school.

It’s long time ago and I really enjoy deal with html and layout things.

Yesterday when I tried to search for some self-hosted blog solutions, some comments on hacker news jump out and get my attention:

> I am the "weird dude who writes raw HTML" LOL.

> I had a self-hosted WordPress blog from 2006-2010, but security updates become a burden, especially since I had to modify the WP source code a little to do exactly what I wanted with the RSS feeds.

> After a few years of not blogging at all, I decided to use the simplest possible "system", which is writing blog posts in raw HTML in a text editor, as well as writing the RSS feed in raw XML in a text editor. It's not pretty, but it's zero maintenance. I've been doing that for 10 years now, and I don't think I'd ever go back to a third-party dependency.

> I should mention my other motivation: occasionally one of my blog posts will get massive traffic, such as #1 HN, or getting linked by the tech media. In cases like these, static HTML files are great. My website never been gotten overwhelmed and becomes unresponsive from the load, even though it's just on a little shared hosted server.

this comment followed by some even interesting one:

> Wait... You don't use an IDE taking up 2GB of RAM to write posts in "plain text" using a random flavor of Markdown, with custom extensions only supported by a single blog generator, and then use the command line to call 250MB worth of Node libraries which creates an AST from the barely parsable text file, all to then generate a basic static HTML file? What's wrong with you? 

I just can’t stop laughing.

Well, it’s 2023 and things become so complicated that I can’t fell the joy of manipulating raw html anymore.

So how about write a blog pure in raw html? Without IDE, without markdown, without any site generator?

That sounds really good ideal and can be on the list: things I want to do before die.

Let’s do it!
