# Turn mac mini into a cd player

## Why CD?

I love music, after reading this article from Nytimes, I just realize that it's time to for me to have
a physical collection of music.

After some search and thought, I think CD is the perfect media to do it:

* It's easy and cheap: after you purchase a cd burner(which cost like 10$ ), you can burn any music you like with a click, and cdr disc is cheap(0.3 $ per disc);
* a lot of music to choose: you can purchase music from iTunes Store which has latest and many old recordings;
* All those big records company still sale CDs
* It has very high audio quality
* I still has a car with cd player builtin, I can simply take the music I like for a trip

## Enjoy music without GUI

Then I want to enjoy music without any disrupte, without any GUI.

So I decide to turn my daily computer(a mac mini) into a cd player.

I have a external CD burner connect with the mac mini, to make it a cd player, these features has to implement:

* autoplay any CD I insert into external cd burner;
* can controled by keyboard to:
  * skip forware/backward
  * volumn up
  * volumn down
  * eject CD
